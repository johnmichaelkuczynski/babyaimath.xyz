# Course design mandates

These are explicit user requirements that a future agent might wrongly "clean up"
because they seem unwarranted for a plain-language, no-math course. They are intentional.

## Math keyboard is mandatory everywhere
A symbol palette (`MathKeyboard`) must be present on EVERY freeform input — answer
inputs (practice, practice-assignments, real assignments) AND the AI tutor chat
boxes — even though the course subject is non-technical and "doesn't seem to warrant it."

**Why:** Direct user mandate ("MAKE SURE THE MATH KEYBOARD IS PRESENT, INCLUDING WITH
AI TUTOR, EVEN IF THE SUBJECT-MATTER DOES NOT SEEM TO WARRANT IT").
**How to apply:** Do not remove the keyboard from any input. Math-keyboard insertions
must count as `keystrokeCount` (not bulk-insert) in the keystroke
trace, or legitimate symbol use false-flags the AI-authorship detector.

## Questions must require operational reasoning, never recitation
ALL questions — homeworks, unit test, final, practice assignments, AND the adaptive
topic drill — must pose a specific concrete scenario and require a multi-sentence
reasoned answer. Never a one-word/single-term/"yes-no" answer, never "define X" or
"recite the abstract formulation from the text."

**Why:** Repeated, emphatic user mandate — answers must be "hard to share" and prove
operational understanding, not memorization. The adaptive drill previously generated
single-word concept-ID questions and was the one place that violated this.
**How to apply:** Any new question-generation prompt must forbid definitions/one-word
answers and demand a concrete case + reasoned answer. The semantic `gradeAnswer` grader
already handles reasoned answers, so longer answers are safe to grade.

## Easily-missed math-keyboard spot: tutor starter-question input
The "all inputs incl tutor" keyboard mandate has a non-obvious hole: the per-lecture
tutor *starter-question* "Try answering" inline input is a separate small component,
not the main answer flow, and historically used a raw `<textarea>` with no keyboard.

**Why:** It's the one tutor input that does NOT go through the shared `AnswerInput`
component, so a grep for keyboard coverage can pass while this spot silently lacks it.
**How to apply:** Route this input through `AnswerInput` (compact) too — never a bare
textarea — so every tutor-adjacent input has the math keyboard.

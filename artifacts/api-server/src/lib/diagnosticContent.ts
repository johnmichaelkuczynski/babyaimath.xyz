// Original content for the embedded diagnostic reasoning assessments.
//
// Two instruments, each offered at FOUR time-points (phases) so a student can
// gauge themselves before, during, and after the course:
//   - subject  — Developmental Psychology subject-specific reasoning. Realistic
//     short cases about the course material; the best-supported answer is keyed
//     first.
//   - general  — General Reasoning. Genuine reasoning items spanning analysis,
//     inference, evaluation, deduction, and induction (NOT a "docility"/agree-
//     with-authority test).
//
// Each (instrument, phase) is offered in THREE selectable answer formats that
// share the same kind of questions:
//   - mcq     — pick the single best option.
//   - hybrid  — pick the best option AND (optionally) write a short note.
//   - written — no options shown; write a short answer in your own words.
//
// These diagnostics are UNGRADED practice: takeable anytime, unlimited times,
// and they never affect the course grade. Every time a test is started, fresh
// questions are generated (see reasoning.ts) so questions never repeat. The
// items below are the structural BLUEPRINT (style + fallback) for that
// generation, grounded per phase by GEN_SPECS.
//
// All items are ORIGINAL. For every item the correct option is written FIRST;
// at seed time options are rotated so the correct answer lands at a varied
// index (see seedDiagnostics.ts). `modelAnswer` is the ideal short written
// response used to grade the written/hybrid formats.

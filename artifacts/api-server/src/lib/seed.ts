    body: `# What developmental psychology is

A baby who can't hold up her head becomes a toddler who runs, then a teenager who argues about everything, then an adult, then an old person looking back on it all. That whole journey is the subject of **developmental psychology** — the careful study of how and why people change across their entire lives.

## A science of change across life

Developmental psychology is a science, which means it doesn't run on cute stories or "common sense" about kids. It uses evidence — careful observation, experiments, and studies that follow the same people for years — to ask things like: *when* do babies start to understand the world, *how* does thinking grow more powerful, and *why* do teenagers take risks. The goal is to describe what really changes, and to explain what drives those changes.

## Stages or smooth growth?

One of the field's oldest questions is whether we change in **stages** — sudden jumps to a new way of being, like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly — or in smooth, gradual steps, like a plant slowly growing taller. The honest answer is "some of both." Some changes (like learning to walk) look like real leaps; others (like getting better at remembering) creep up gradually. Knowing which is which is a big part of the work.

## Three kinds of growth at once

To keep things clear, developmental psychologists watch three areas at the same time: **physical** growth (the body and brain), **cognitive** growth (thinking, memory, and language), and **social-emotional** growth (feelings and relationships). These are tangled together — a baby who can finally crawl (physical) suddenly explores more, learns more (cognitive), and bumps into new rules from parents (social). Real development is all three braided into one rope.

## Why this matters

This isn't just for scientists. The same ideas shape how we raise children, design schools, write laws about teenagers, and care for the elderly. When adults misunderstand how children grow — expecting a three-year-old to "just be reasonable," or treating a teenager's brain as a finished adult brain — real people get hurt or blamed for things they can't yet do. Understanding development is a kind of fairness across every age.

## In the real world

Some of the most powerful evidence comes from **longitudinal studies** — projects that follow the very same people for decades. In New Zealand, researchers tracked over a thousand babies born in the same town from birth into middle age, measuring them again and again. That patient, year-after-year watching revealed how early traits, family life, and luck weave together over a lifetime — something no single snapshot of a person could ever show. It's a reminder that development is a story, and you have to watch the whole thing to understand it.`,

    blurb: "It was never 'genes OR environment' — who you become grows out of the two working together, constantly.",
    lectureTitle: "1.2 Nature vs. nurture (the argument that won't die)",
    body: `# Nature vs. nurture

Here's an argument that has run for centuries and refuses to end: are we shaped by **nature** — the genes we're born with — or by **nurture** — the world that raises us? People still take sides as if it's a sports match. But the real answer, the one the evidence keeps pointing to, is that the question itself is wrong. It was never one or the other.

## Two answers that are both incomplete

"Nature" says you arrive with a fixed blueprint: your genes set your height, your temperament, maybe even your talents. "Nurture" says you arrive as a blank slate, and your family, friends, and experiences write the whole story. Each side captures something true — and each, on its own, is clearly false. Identical twins raised apart end up similar in surprising ways (score one for nature), yet a child's language, habits, and fears are obviously shaped by where they grow up (score one for nurture).

## Genes set a range, the world picks the spot

A better way to think about it: your genes often set a **range** of possibilities, and your environment decides where inside that range you land. Height is a clear example — good genes set how tall you *could* grow, but poor nutrition can keep you well below it. The same logic reaches into the mind: a child might be born with the potential to be a strong reader, but only a world full of books and conversation turns that potential into the real thing.

## They don't just add — they interact

The deepest idea is that nature and nurture don't sit in separate boxes; they **interact.** A naturally bold, active baby pulls different reactions out of the world than a quiet, cautious one — so the same parents end up creating different environments for each child. Genes shape the experiences you have, and experiences can even change how genes get used. Asking "how much is nature and how much is nurture?" is a bit like asking whether a song is more about the notes or the playing.

## Why the either/or is dangerous

Picking a side has real costs. Believe everything is "nature" and you start treating people's troubles as fixed and hopeless — why bother helping? Believe everything is "nurture" and you blame parents for every difference and ignore real inborn needs. The grown-up view — that the two always work together — keeps us both realistic about what's hard to change and hopeful about what isn't.

## In the real world

There's a genetic condition called PKU where, because of a single faulty gene, the body can't handle a substance found in ordinary food — and the buildup once caused serious intellectual disability. It sounds like pure "nature," a fate written in the genes. But the harm only happens if the child *eats* that substance. Put the baby on a special diet — a change in **nurture** — and development proceeds normally. One faulty gene, one change in the environment, and the outcome flips completely. It's the whole nature-and-nurture lesson in a single story.`,

    lectureTitle: "1.3 The infant mind (what babies know before they can speak)",
    body: `# The infant mind

For a long time people assumed a newborn's mind was a "blooming, buzzing confusion" — a blank, helpless blob that knew nothing. That picture turned out to be spectacularly wrong. Modern research shows that babies arrive already prepared for the world, packed with preferences and expectations, long before they can say a single word.

## Born ready for people

Within days of birth, babies already prefer some things over others — and most of those things are *people.* Newborns turn toward human faces more than scrambled patterns, prefer their own mother's voice to a stranger's, and like the rhythm of the language they heard in the womb. They aren't passive. From the start, a baby is built to seek out the faces and voices that will keep it alive and teach it everything. The "blank slate" was never blank.

## How do you study a baby who can't talk?

Here's the clever problem: you can't *ask* a baby what it knows. So researchers learned to read the two things babies control — **where they look** and **how long.** Babies stare longer at things that are new or surprising and look away from things that have become boring. By carefully measuring those gazes, scientists can ask a baby "does this surprise you?" without a single word — and the baby answers with its eyes.

## The surprise test

Use that trick and something amazing appears. Show a baby an event that breaks the rules of the physical world — an object that seems to pass through a solid wall, or two toys that become three when nothing was added — and the baby **stares longer**, as if to say "wait, that's not possible." That extra staring is evidence that even young infants already expect objects to be solid, to keep existing when hidden, and to add up correctly. They have a rough physics in their heads before they can crawl.

## Out of sight, not gone

One famous milestone is **object permanence** — understanding that a thing still exists even when you can't see it. Very young babies act as if a hidden toy has simply vanished; a bit later, they'll search for it under a blanket. For decades people thought this understanding arrived slowly and late. The looking-time studies suggest babies grasp it earlier than they can *show* with their clumsy hands — knowing and doing don't always arrive together.

## In the real world

In one elegant study, researchers showed babies a simple "math" scene: one doll placed behind a screen, then a second doll added behind it. When the screen dropped to reveal only *one* doll — an impossible result — the babies stared much longer than when two dolls appeared. Months before they could speak or count, they expected one plus one to make two, and were startled when it didn't. The infant mind, it turns out, is already quietly keeping track of the world.`,

    lectureTitle: "1.4 Attachment (why the first bond shapes everything)",
    body: `# Attachment

Watch a one-year-old in a new place and you'll see it: she explores, then glances back to make sure her caregiver is still there, then explores a little further. That invisible thread between a baby and the person who cares for it is called **attachment**, and studying it changed how the whole world thinks about raising children.

## More than feeding

People used to assume babies love their caregivers simply because they're the source of food — "cupboard love." Then experiments with baby monkeys shattered that idea. Given a choice between a bare wire "mother" that provided milk and a soft cloth "mother" that provided none, the frightened babies clung to the soft one and ran to it for comfort. **Contact and comfort**, not just food, turned out to be the heart of the bond. We are wired to seek closeness, not just calories.

## A secure base

A good attachment works like a **secure base.** Because the caregiver is reliable, the child feels safe enough to wander off, try new things, and learn — knowing there's a safe spot to run back to when the world gets scary. This is why attachment isn't the opposite of independence; it's the *launchpad* for it. The most confident explorers are usually the ones who feel most certain someone has their back.

## Measuring the bond

To study attachment, researchers designed a careful little drama: a baby plays in a room, the caregiver briefly leaves, a stranger appears, and the caregiver returns. The key moment isn't the leaving — it's the **reunion.** A securely attached baby is upset when the caregiver goes but is comforted and soothed on return. Other babies show insecure patterns: some seem indifferent, others can't be calmed. Watching that reunion gives a surprisingly clear window into the relationship.

## Patterns, not destiny

These early patterns matter — secure attachment is linked to easier friendships and steadier emotions later on. But it's important not to overstate it. Attachment can change as relationships change, and one early pattern does not lock in a person's whole future. Like everything in this course, it's a strong influence and a set of odds, not a switch that decides the rest of a life.

## In the real world

The monkey study with the wire and cloth "mothers" is one of the most famous in all of psychology precisely because the result was so clear and so moving: comfort beat food, every time. Around the same time, careful observation of human babies separated from caregivers showed how deeply distressing that loss is — and how much steady, responsive care matters. Together, this work helped end the old advice to handle babies coldly "so they won't get spoiled," and replaced it with something kinder and truer: babies need warmth as surely as they need milk.`,

    lectureTitle: "1.5 How children think (Piaget and the stages of mind)",
    body: `# How children think

Ask a four-year-old why it gets dark at night and you might hear "so people can sleep." That's not just a wrong fact — it's a glimpse of a whole different *way* of thinking. The great insight of **Jean Piaget** was that children aren't simply adults who know less. Their minds work by different rules, and those rules change in a predictable order as they grow.

## Children build their own understanding

Piaget saw children as little scientists, constantly building and testing their own theories about how the world works. They take in new experiences and fit them into what they already understand — and when something won't fit, they're forced to rebuild their theory into something better. Thinking grows not by adults pouring facts in, but by the child actively making sense of the world, over and over.

## Four big stages

Piaget described thinking as moving through four broad stages. In the **sensorimotor** stage, babies "think" through senses and actions — grabbing, mouthing, banging. In the **preoperational** stage, young children can use words and imagination but reason in ways that look strange to adults. In the **concrete operational** stage, school-age children get logical about real, concrete things. And in **formal operational** thinking, adolescents become able to reason about abstract ideas and "what ifs." The order, Piaget argued, is the same everywhere.

## Why a young child gets fooled

Two classic quirks show how preschoolers think. In **conservation**, pour water from a short, wide glass into a tall, thin one and a young child insists there's now *more* water — they fix on the height and miss that nothing was added or removed. And in **egocentrism**, young children struggle to picture a scene from anyone's viewpoint but their own. These aren't signs of a "dumb" child; they're signs of a mind that hasn't yet built certain logical tools.

## Piaget was right, and incomplete

Later researchers showed Piaget was onto something huge but also got some things wrong — mostly by *underestimating* children. With simpler, friendlier tests, kids often reveal understanding earlier than his tasks suggested, and development turns out to be less neatly step-like than four tidy stages imply. That's science working as it should: a brilliant theory opens the door, and the people who follow refine it.

## In the real world

The water-glass conservation task is so reliable you can almost do it at a birthday party. Show a young child two identical glasses with the same amount of juice, then pour one into a taller, skinnier glass while they watch every drop. Ask which has more, and the preschooler will confidently point to the tall one — "it's bigger!" A year or two later, the very same child will look at you like the question is silly: "It's the same, you just poured it." Nothing changed but the glass; everything changed in the mind.`,

    blurb: "Every typical toddler cracks the code of language without lessons — one of the most astonishing feats humans pull off.",
    lectureTitle: "1.6 Language (the astonishing feat every toddler pulls off)",
    body: `# Language

Think about what a three-year-old can do: take a stream of sounds, figure out where the words are, learn thousands of them, and string them into sentences nobody taught them word-by-word — all without a single grammar lesson. No adult could learn a new language that fast. Yet nearly every toddler on Earth does it. How is one of the biggest puzzles in this whole field.

## The same path, everywhere

Children around the world learn language in a strikingly similar order. First **cooing**, then **babbling** ("bababa") that practices the sounds, then first words around the first birthday, then a sudden **word explosion** where new words pour in. Early sentences are **telegraphic** — "want cookie," "doggie gone" — keeping the important words and dropping the rest. This shared timetable, across wildly different languages and cultures, is a big clue that something deep and built-in is at work.

## Built-in or taught?

So is language **nature** or **nurture**? One side argues the human brain comes pre-wired for grammar — that children couldn't possibly learn something so complex so fast unless they were born ready for it. The other side points out that children clearly need to *hear* language: the words and patterns they learn obviously come from the people around them, and children who are talked with more tend to develop language faster. As with everything in this course, the truth lives in the overlap — a prepared brain meeting a world full of talk.

## The mistakes that prove the rule

Here's the most delightful evidence that kids learn *rules*, not just copy phrases: they make errors no adult ever modeled. A child who once correctly said "went" starts saying "goed"; "feet" becomes "foots"; "ran" becomes "runned." Nobody ever says those words to them. The child has figured out the rule — add "-ed," add "-s" — and is over-applying it to words that break the rule. Those "mistakes" are actually a sign of a powerful little mind discovering the hidden logic of language.

## A window that narrows

Language also shows a **sensitive period** — a stretch of childhood when the brain soaks up language with astonishing ease. Young children pick up a language, or two, almost effortlessly; adults grind at it and rarely sound native. Tragic cases of children deprived of any language in early childhood show how hard full language becomes if that early window is missed. The door doesn't slam, but it does narrow with age.

## In the real world

Researchers tested whether kids really learn rules using made-up words. They showed children a cartoon creature and said, "This is a wug." Then they showed two of them: "Now there are two ___?" Without hesitation, little children said "wugs" — adding the plural to a word they had never heard before and that doesn't exist. They couldn't have memorized it; they *applied a rule.* That tiny made-up animal is one of the clearest proofs that toddlers aren't parrots — they're code-breakers.`,

    lectureTitle: "1.7 The teenage brain (why adolescence looks the way it does)",
    body: `# The teenage brain

Adults love to complain about teenagers: moody, impulsive, glued to friends, drawn to risk. It's tempting to write it off as bad attitude or laziness. But brain science tells a more interesting story. The teenage brain isn't broken or finished — it's in the middle of a massive, necessary renovation, and a lot of "teenage behavior" makes sense once you see the construction site.

## Still under construction

For a long time people assumed the brain was basically done by childhood. It isn't. The brain keeps rewiring deep into the **mid-twenties**, getting faster and more efficient. Adolescence isn't a finished product behaving badly; it's a work in progress, pruning unused connections and speeding up the ones that remain. The teenager you know is, quite literally, running on a brain that's still being built.

## The gas pedal and the brakes

The key clue is *which* parts grow up first. The brain's emotional, reward-seeking system — the "gas pedal" that craves excitement, fun, and approval — matures **early**, around puberty. But the **prefrontal cortex** — the "brakes" that handle planning, judgment, and impulse control — matures **last**, into the mid-twenties. For a few years, the gas pedal is floored while the brakes are still being installed. That mismatch, not stupidity, drives a lot of teenage risk-taking.

## Why friends matter so much

Teenagers don't just take more risks; they take far more when **friends are watching.** This isn't simple peer pressure — the teenage brain finds social approval intensely rewarding, so the presence of peers literally cranks up the pull of a risky-but-exciting choice. From the inside, fitting in and seeking thrills feel enormously important, because for the developing brain, they are. Understanding this changes how we should think about teen behavior in groups.

## A feature, not just a bug

Here's the surprise: this design may be useful, not just dangerous. Adolescence is when humans must leave the safety of childhood, try new things, take social risks, and build a life apart from their parents. A brain tuned toward novelty, excitement, and friendship is well-suited to that leap. The same wiring that leads to reckless choices also powers creativity, passion, and the courage to strike out on one's own. The trick is keeping teens safe while the brakes finish installing.

## In the real world

In one clever experiment, teens and adults played a risky driving video game, sometimes alone and sometimes with friends watching. Adults drove about the same either way. But teenagers took **far more risks when peers were present** — running more yellow lights, pushing their luck — even though no one said a word. The mere presence of friends lit up the reward system and tipped the balance toward thrill. It's vivid evidence that the teenage brain isn't just a smaller adult brain; it's tuned to a different, noisier station.`,

    lectureTitle: "1.8 Aging and the lifespan, and what comes next (Capstone)",
    body: `# Aging and the lifespan (capstone)

We end where most people assume development is already over: adulthood and old age. The biggest myth about the lifespan is that growth happens in childhood and then we just slowly run down. The truth is far more interesting — we keep developing until the very end, and later life brings real losses *and* real gains that the science is only now appreciating.

## Development never stops

The whole point of a *lifespan* view is that change is never finished. Adults learn new skills, take on new roles, rebuild after setbacks, and rethink who they are well into old age. Some abilities fade, yes — but others ripen. Treating adulthood as a flat plateau or a long decline misses most of the human story. The same scientific curiosity we aimed at babies belongs on every decade of life.

## Losing some, gaining some

Aging is best understood as a mix of **losses and gains.** Raw mental speed and the ability to juggle brand-new information — sometimes called *fluid* abilities — tend to decline with age. But accumulated knowledge, vocabulary, and hard-won judgment — *crystallized* abilities — often hold steady or keep growing for decades. The older mind is slower at some games and far richer at others. It's not simply "worse"; it's *different*, with a different set of strengths.

## The surprising happiness of later life

Here's a finding that startles almost everyone: older adults, on average, often report being **as happy or happier** than younger ones, and handle their emotions more smoothly. One leading explanation is that when people sense time is more limited, they stop chasing everything and focus on what matters most — close relationships and meaningful moments. The narrowing of time, oddly, sharpens the focus on joy. Aging isn't only a story of decline; for many, it's a story of getting better at living.

## Tying the course together

Look back across all eight topics and one thread runs through them: **resist the simple story.** Development isn't pure nature or pure nurture; babies aren't blank; children don't think like little adults; teenagers aren't just badly behaved; and old age isn't just decline. Again and again, the careful evidence replaces a tidy myth with something richer, stranger, and more humane. That habit — looking past the obvious story to what's really happening — is the most valuable thing to carry out of this course.

## The biggest questions stay open

And plenty remains unsolved. How much can we shape our own development? Why do some people thrive after hardship while others struggle? How do we help every stage of life go well, from the first bond to the last years? Developmental psychology gives us better questions and more honest answers — not final ones. The single habit worth keeping is this: whenever someone offers a simple, certain story about how people grow and change, ask, "Is that real, or is it a myth?"`,

        correctAnswer:
          "This is the classic conservation task, and the child's answer shows their thinking follows different rules than an adult's, not that they're unintelligent. The preschooler fixes on one feature — the height of the liquid — and misses that nothing was added or removed, so the amount must be the same.

          "These errors are a sign the child is learning rules, not just copying phrases.

          "Developmental psychology is the careful, evidence-based study of how and why people change across their entire lives, from before birth to old age — using observation, experiments, and studies that follow the same people for years rather than relying on common sense about kids. A core idea is the lifespan view: change never stops, so adulthood and old age are part of the story too, not just childhood. At every stage it watches three braided areas at once — physical growth (body and brain), cognitive growth (thinking, memory, language), and social-emotional growth (feelings and relationships). These domains are tangled together, so a single change like learning to crawl ripples across all three.

          "The either/or is wrong because nature and nurture always work together rather than competing. Genes often set a range of possibilities, and the environment decides where inside that range a person lands — like good genes setting how tall you could grow while nutrition determines how tall you actually become. The deeper point is that the two interact: an inborn temperament shapes the experiences a child has, so a bold baby and a cautious baby pull different environments out of the same parents, and experiences can even change how genes get used. That's why asking 'how much is nature and how much is nurture' is like asking whether a song is more the notes or the playing. Picking a side also causes harm — pure 'nature' breeds hopelessness, pure 'nurture' breeds blame — while the grown-up view stays both realistic and hopeful.",

Even young infants appear to expect objects to be solid and to keep existing when hidden, and some studies suggest they expect simple amounts to add up correctly. Researchers can't ask a baby what it knows, so they read the two things babies control: where they look and for how long. Babies stare longer at events that are new or surprising and look away from boring ones, so showing a baby an 'impossible' event — an object passing through a wall, or one plus one appearing to make one — and measuring the extra staring reveals what the baby expected. That longer look at rule-breaking events is the evidence that the infant mind already tracks the world.",

It's not just about feeding: experiments with baby monkeys showed that frightened babies clung to a soft, cloth 'mother' that gave no milk rather than a bare wire one that did, so contact and comfort, not just calories, are the heart of the bond. A good attachment works as a 'secure base': because the caregiver is reliable, the child feels safe enough to explore, try new things, and learn, knowing there's a safe spot to return to. That's why attachment isn't the opposite of independence — it's the launchpad for it, since the most confident explorers usually feel most certain someone has their back.

          "Piaget's central insight was that children aren't simply adults who know less — their minds work by different rules that change in a predictable order as they grow, and children actively build their own understanding rather than just absorbing facts. Conservation shows this clearly: pour the same juice into a taller, thinner glass and a preschooler insists there's now more, because they fix on the height and miss that nothing was added or removed. Egocentrism is another example — young children struggle to picture a scene from anyone's viewpoint but their own. These aren't signs of a dumb child but of a mind that hasn't yet built certain logical tools, which develop in later stages. Later researchers refined Piaget by showing he often underestimated children: with simpler, friendlier tests, kids reveal understanding earlier than his tasks suggested, and development is less neatly step-like than four tidy stages imply.",

Children worldwide follow a strikingly similar path: cooing, babbling, first words, a word explosion, and telegraphic speech like 'want cookie,' which hints at something built in. The clearest proof that they learn rules rather than imitate is errors like 'goed' or 'foots' — words no adult ever says to them.

Genes typically set a range of possibilities while the environment decides where inside it a person lands — good height genes still need good nutrition to be realized, and a child born to be a strong reader needs a world full of books and talk to get there. The two also interact: an inborn temperament shapes the experiences a child has, so a bold baby and a cautious one draw different environments out of the very same parents, and experiences can even change how genes are used. A striking example is the genetic condition PKU, where a single faulty gene once caused serious intellectual disability — yet the harm only happens if the child eats a certain substance, so a simple change in diet (nurture) lets development proceed normally. One gene, one environmental change, and the whole outcome flips. That's why 'genes decide everything' mistakes a starting point for a finished story.",

    body: `# How to reason about developmental psychology cases

This short primer prepares you for the **Developmental Psychology** diagnostic. That check is *ungraded practice* — it never affects your course grade. It is drawn from the eight topics of this unit and asks you to *apply* what you have learned to a specific situation, not to recite a definition.

## It tests application, not memorization

A diagnostic question gives you a small, concrete scene — a baby, a preschooler, a teenager, an aging adult — and asks what the course's ideas tell you about it. Knowing the word "object permanence" or "attachment" is not enough; the question wants you to recognize *when* you are looking at one and *why* it matters here.

## What the questions reward

- **Naming the right idea** — match the situation to the concept that fits it: whether a behavior reflects nature, nurture, or both; what babies already know; how children think differently; how language is learned; why teenagers take risks; how aging brings gains as well as losses.
- **Using evidence from the scene** — point to the detail in the situation that supports your answer, rather than answering from a general impression.
- **Avoiding the simple story** — the course replaces tidy myths with careful explanation. The best answers resist "it's all genes," "babies know nothing," or "it's all downhill," and stay grounded in the science.

## How to do this activity well

1. **Read the situation first**, then ask which topic it belongs to.
2. **Find the detail that decides it** — what in the scene makes one answer better than another.
3. For written items, **give the core idea in a sentence or two** — clear and correct beats long and padded.

Take it as often as you like; the questions are freshly generated every time, and there is no penalty for any answer.`,

    body: `# Core reasoning skills

This short primer prepares you for the **General Reasoning** diagnostic — an *ungraded* check that tests five genuine reasoning skills. These are the same skills you use to decide what a set of facts really shows, so they matter directly for thinking clearly about how people grow and change.

## The five skills

- **Analysis** — break an argument into parts: find its **point** (the conclusion), the **reasons** given for it, and any hidden assumption it leans on. Ask: "What is this trying to convince me of, and what does it take for granted?"
- **Inference** — work out what *follows* from what you're told, and how strongly. Tell apart what *must* be true, what is *likely*, and what is only *possible*.
- **Evaluation** — judge how much the reasons actually support the point. Notice when evidence is beside the point, a source isn't trustworthy, or a step doesn't really connect.
- **Deduction** — reasoning where true starting facts *guarantee* the conclusion. If the starting facts are true, the conclusion can't be false. Watch for sneaky forms that only *look* airtight.
- **Induction** — reasoning from a few examples to a *probable* general rule or prediction. Strong induction uses many fair examples; weak induction over-generalizes from too few.

## A recurring trap: things that move together

Most wrong answers are statements that *sound* reasonable but are **not actually backed up by what you were told**. The discipline this check rewards is the same one careful thinking about human development demands: keep apart what the facts **show**, what you're **assuming**, and what only *sounds* right. Two things happening together does not prove one causes the other.

## How to do this activity well

1. Find the **point** (conclusion) first, then the reasons.
2. Ask which of the five skills the question is testing (a hidden-assumption question is analysis; a "what follows" question is inference or deduction; a "how good is this reasoning" question is evaluation).
3. Pick the option that follows **only** from what you were given — not the one that merely sounds true or appealing.

Take it as often as you like; the questions are freshly generated every time, and it never affects your grade.`,
